# PayLog Smart Upgrades (Personal Expense Focus)

Keep the simplicity and personal nature while adding intelligence and utility.

## Tier 1: Smart Transaction Logging

### Quick Input Shortcuts
- **Voice Transactions**: Record expenses by voice (₹500 groceries) instead of typing
- **Frequent Transactions**: Remember your common transactions (coffee ₹50, fuel ₹500) and let you one-tap them
- **Smart Autocomplete**: "sub 500 gro" → suggests "groceries" completion
- **Amount Presets**: Save common amounts (coffee, lunch, cab fare) for one-click entry

### Intelligent Parsing
- **Natural Language**: "Spent 500 on groceries at DMart" → bot extracts amount, category, location
- **Time Recognition**: "Yesterday I spent 1000 on dinner" → bot logs with correct date
- **Alias Support**: Define shortcuts ("gro" = groceries, "fuel" = petrol)

## Tier 2: Personal Analytics & Insights

### Spending Patterns
- **Daily Average**: "You typically spend ₹800/day on food"
- **Expense Trends**: "Your groceries spend increased 20% this month"
- **Budget Comparison**: "You've spent 60% of your typical wallet limit (if you set one)"
- **Category Breakdown**: "This month: 40% food, 30% transport, 20% shopping, 10% other"
- **Spending Forecast**: "At this rate, you'll spend ₹25,000 this month"

### Smart Alerts
- **Spending Spike Alert**: "⚠️ You spent ₹5000 on shopping today—that's 3x your daily average"
- **Category Threshold**: "You've spent ₹2000 on food this week (your average is ₹1500)"
- **Weekly Summary**: Auto-send Friday recap: "You spent ₹8500 this week"
- **Monthly Warning**: "10 days left in month, ₹5000 spent, pace: ₹15,000 total"

### Personal Goals & Limits
- **Set Spending Caps**: "Don't let me spend more than ₹1000/day on food"
- **Savings Tracker**: "I want to save ₹500 this week" → tracks progress
- **Challenge Mode**: "Challenge: Don't spend more than ₹100 on groceries this week"

## Tier 3: Contextual Awareness

### Smart Categorization
- **Learning From You**: Bot learns your patterns (time of day, amount ranges) and suggests categories
- **Location-Based**: Remember that ATM is for cash withdrawal, that store is for groceries
- **Recurring Expenses**: Auto-categorize repeated transactions (daily coffee, weekly grocery)
- **Merchant Recognition**: Store names → automatic category (Starbucks → food, Uber → transport)

### Context Memory
- **Recent Context**: You say "subtract 500" after saying "groceries"—bot remembers and applies category
- **Quick Follow-ups**: "Add 200 to that" → understands you mean add to the same category/wallet
- **Transaction History**: Quick search/filter ("show me all food expenses from last week")

## Tier 4: Multi-Wallet Intelligence

### Wallet Management
- **Transfer Suggestions**: "You usually transfer ₹2000 on Fridays—transfer now?"
- **Rebalancing Alerts**: "Your wallet has ₹50, time to refill?"
- **Usage Patterns**: Track which wallet you use most for what (food from wallet, bills from stack)

### Cash Flow Visualization
- **Flow Chart**: See money movement between wallets daily/weekly
- **Burn Rate**: "You're spending ₹1200/day from wallet" 
- **Days Left**: "At current rate, your wallet cash lasts 10 more days"

## Tier 5: Lending 2.0 (Personal Focus)

### Smarter Lending Tracking
- **Debt Reminders**: "You lent Rahul ₹5000 on Oct 1—follow up?" (after 2 weeks)
- **Lending Analytics**: "You've lent ₹25000 total; ₹15000 returned, ₹10000 pending"
- **Settlement Suggestions**: "Rahul owes you ₹3000, Priya owes ₹2000—you could settle with person X"
- **Auto-Track Returns**: "Money returned from Rahul—add to wallet or stack?"
- **Lending Patterns**: "You typically lend ₹500-₹2000, average return time: 10 days"

### Group Lending (Optional, Stay Personal)
- **Simple Group Split**: "Dinner was ₹3000, 3 of us—everyone owes ₹1000" (tracks who owes)
- **Trip Expenses**: Track who paid what on a group trip, auto-calculate settlement
- **Roommate Expenses**: Keep separate ledger for shared expenses with roommate

## Tier 6: Export & Integration (But Keep Data Private)
